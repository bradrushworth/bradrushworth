👋 Hi, I’m Brad Rushworth, the managing director of [BitBot Software Pty Ltd](https://www.bitbot.com.au/) and principal software developer.

👀 I’m interested in developing mobile apps that bring people joy and help them explore the world around them.

🌱 I’m currently learning Flutter/Dart and my most recent hobby projects using [Flutter](https://flutter.dev/) are [Momentum Energy Dashboard](https://github.com/bradrushworth/momentumenergy) and [Ant Nuptial Flight Predictor](https://github.com/bradrushworth/nuptialflight). I'm also interested in Crypto projects and learning about the opportunities in this space.

💞️ If you are located in Australia, I’m looking to collaborate with people on the app Aus Phone Towers either [Google Play](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=au.com.bitbot.phonetowers) or [iPhone App Store](https://apps.apple.com/au/app/aus-phone-towers-3g-4g-5g/id1488594332). I'm an Android user myself so the Android version gets a lot more love, its written in native Java, but its not yet open-sourced (if you're interested contact me and we'll work something out). The iPhone version is written in Flutter and is [already open-sourced](https://github.com/bradrushworth/aus_phone_towers_iphone). I'd love your contribution.

📫 You can reach me on bitbot@bitbot.com.au or through https://www.bitbot.com.au or on [Whirlpool](https://forums.whirlpool.net.au/user/739655).

💰 If you'd like to thank me for any of my work that benefited you, any donations made in my apps, to [buy me a coffee](https://www.buymeacoffee.com/bitbot) or my crypto wallet (@bitbotsoftware on Solana) would be greatly appreciated.

🙌 Have a great day!
